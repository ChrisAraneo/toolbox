# ⚒️ Toolbox

Monorepo for reactive abstractions, wrappers and utility code.
Packages shared as [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~chris.araneo).

## ❓ Motivation

I found myself reusing code across multiple projects. I decided to put it in a single monorepo and then publish it on npm.

## 📦 Packages

- @chris.araneo/file-system - Reactive file system abstractions and wrappers. Can be used to find files, read jsons, write files & more.
- @chris.araneo/crypto - Easy encrypting and decrypting files.
- @chris.araneo/ftp - Upload directory to FTP in RxJS way.
- @chris.araneo/logger - Logger that uses Winston under the hood.

## 💿 Installing dependencies
